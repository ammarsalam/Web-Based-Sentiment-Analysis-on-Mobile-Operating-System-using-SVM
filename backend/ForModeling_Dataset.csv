integrity bypass module are extracted from and those keyboxes are the ones getting banned Why do you think youre immune from this On top of that the news post is literally talking about Google strengthening play integrity and making hardware backed integrity more prominent Dont confuse google giving their developers the option to use it with enforcing them to use it If an app dev requires it then thats between you and the app dev Use the website Thats like saying Apple doesnt have a monopoly because its actually the devs choosing to put their apps on iOS Google is responsible for platform lockout through that feature regardless of who chooses to use it Google also doesnt control the entire android ecosystem If you think so then look at projects such as GrapheneOSetc The team behind GrapheneOS literally speaks out regularly about Googles anticompetitive action through play integrity IE was developed by MS It comes with the OS They werent sued because they included IE They were sued because they bribed manufactures with creditscash to ONLY offer IEwindows Did you read the text you yourself quoted United States of America v Microsoft Corporation Fd DC Cir was a landmark American antitrust law case at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit The US government accused Microsoft of illegally monopolizing the web browser market for Windows primarily through the legal and technical restrictions it put on the abilities of PC manufacturers OEMs and users to uninstall Internet Explorer and use other programs such as Netscape and Java Further from that same Wikipedia article The government alleged that Microsoft had abused monopoly power on Intelbased personal computers in its handling of operating system and web browser integration The central issue was whether Microsoft was allowed to bundle its IE web browser software with its Windows operating system The case organized by the Department of Justice was focused less on interoperability and more on predatory strategies and market barriers to entry the DOJ built upon the allegation that Microsoft forced computer makers to include its Internet browser as a part of the installation of Windows software Microsoft tried to skirt it by pretending removing IE would cripple windows A number of videotapes were submitted as evidence by Microsoft during the trial including one that demonstrated that removing Internet Explorer from Microsoft Windows caused slowdowns and malfunctions in Windows In the videotaped demonstration of what thenMicrosoft vice president Jim Allchin stated to be a seamless segment filmed on one PC the government noticed that some icons mysteriously disappeared and reappeared on the PCs desktop suggesting that the effects might have been falsified Microsoft later submitted a second inaccurate videotape into evidence The issue was how easy or difficult it was for America Online users to download and install Netscape Navigator onto a Windows PC Microsofts videotape showed the process as being quick and easy resulting in the Netscape icon appearing on the users desktop The government produced its own videotape of the same process revealing that Microsofts videotape had conveniently removed a long and complex part of the procedure and that the Netscape icon was not placed on the desktop requiring a user to search for it Brad Chase a Microsoft vice president verified the governments tape and conceded that Microsofts own tape was falsified So no it wasnt just about bribing what would even be the bribe here its just a business deal like you think Microsoft got nailed because they tried to pull the embrace extend extinguish policy google is following now,permanent use phone designed pre hardware attestation android

iOS,RCS-enhanced iMessage in iOS 18 still has security issues when adding Android users,22-09-2024 01:21:35,22-09-2024 01:29:06,Apples adoption of the RCS protocol in iOS has improved communications in iMessage between users of iPhones and Android but some security issues remain Apple and Google are working together to fix them Apples adoption of RCS in iOS will not change the green bubble status of Android messages on iPhone but behind the scenes the update has brought a number of improvements Videos GIFs and photos sent in messages between the two platforms now retain their original quality level for example iPhone users also now see when an Android user youre in a chat with is typing prior to their finished message appearing and they will see the same when youre typing Read receipts and delivery notifications between platforms now work as they have done when chatting with iPhone users Its also now seamless for both iPhone and Android users to add and manage participants in a group chat originated on either platform Scheduling messages to Android device users the way you can to Apple users is still not possible but Apple claims that is a problem with RCS Messages sent to other messaging apps or platforms previously also may have the caption text message to remind senders that the message was being sent to someone with an Android device or an Apple user who had turned off iMessage capability for some reason In iOS the caption will be replaced with RCS letting users know it is being sent on the new standard That said its not all green bubbles and blue bubbles dancing a field together just yet as the Washington Post points out Some problems remain that for example are not present in secure crossplatform thirdparty apps like WhatsApp or Signal but Apple and Google say they are working together to solve these issues The biggest issue is the level of messaging security When you chat or send attachments using iMessage to other Apple users everything between the parties is endtoend encrypted This is not the case when sending messages to an Android user and if there are any Android users in a group chat nobody in the chat is endtoend encrypted A much more minor problem reported in iOS is that stickers sent in texts by Apple users disappear on Android phones after a few seconds The ability to send a message to an Android user when using inflight WiFi or when the WiFi connection is less than rocksolid doesnt work properly Google WhatsApp Signal and other internetbased messaging apps allow for scheduling messages to users on both Apple and Android platforms but iMessage currently only offers scheduled message delivery between Apple devices Apple could solve these issues by using security and other proprietary addons in iMessage the way others like WhatsApp Signal and Google do Instead Apple has opted to collaborate with Google on several initiatives to upgrade the RCS standard itself and that work is already well underway On the plus side this will ultimately result in a better RCS universal standard for all platforms and messaging apps and bring iMessage up to speed with thirdparty messaging apps for crossplatform compatibility The downside is that it will likely take longer for the AppleGoogle security proposals to be adopted into RCS since it has to go through a lengthy approval process Until then Apple users who have lots of Androidusing contacts may want to consider using WhatsApp or Signal particularly in group chats for better security and features that iMessage currently only offers Apple device owners While the risk is generally considered low group chats in iMessage with Android users are for now less secure and less private than they should be,apple adoption rcs protocol io improved communication imessage user
